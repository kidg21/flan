FLAN is LightBox’s Design Language System for products and experiences. With the LightBox Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, and human interface guidelines.

Our system includes application theming capabilities, responsive flex layout, and accessibily designed components. Based off the principles of atomic design, FLAN provides the basic building blocks of a User Interface. Our Component System is organized into atoms, blocks, elements, layouts, and templates. Additionally this system showcases our Design Guidelines, Colors, and Icon Library.


<h2 style={{color: "rgb(0, 160, 223)"}}>Introduction</h2>

As LightBox’s official design system, FLAN serves a wide range of designers and developers building digital products and experiences. It is maintained by a core team of designers and developers based in the Irvine, California LightBox Office.

The goals of the design system include improving UI consistency and quality, making the design and development process more efficient and focused, establishing a shared vocabulary between designer and developer, and providing clear, discoverable guidance around design and development best practices.

<h2 style={{color: "rgb(0, 160, 223)"}}>Guiding principles</h2>

**FLAN is open.** The design system is a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement. FLAN’s users are also its makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute.

**FLAN is inclusive.** It’s designed and built to be accessible to all, regardless of ability or situation.

**FLAN is modular and flexible.** The system’s modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. Its components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.

**FLAN puts the user first.** Using rigorous research into users’ needs and desires, FLAN is laser-focused on real people.

**FLAN builds consistency.** Based on the LightBox Design Language, every element and component of FLAN was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.

<h2 style={{color: "rgb(0, 160, 223)"}}>Adoption</h2>

The LightBox Design team encourages adoption through guidance, community contribution, maintenance, and support. The system is primarily maintained by a core team and governed by an executive board of design advisors.

Contributed components and patterns include a list of maintainers. The FLAN team believes in continual improvement and welcomes maintenance requests. Unmaintained components will be considered custom components that do not fall under the FLAN team's governance and they may choose not to maintain them. Custom components will have to go through a review process by the FLAN core designers and developers to assess whether it should be adopted into the design system.

We provide support for users of the design system. The FLAN team engages with users primarily through BitBucket. A member of the FLAN team responds to all issues and pull requests.

Please consult this site for examples and rules for putting together the UI.
