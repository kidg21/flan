## Changelog

Until we have an initial versioned `Master` release I will be using this space to document changes to the `Development` branch. Eventually, this will turn into a proper changlog.  We'll do our best to communicate positive and negative impacts of each update.  Bear with us as we work through this approach.  As always, feedback is welcome.

Eventually this document will only pertain to updates to the `Master` branch.  All changes to the `Development` branch will be documented under 'Unreleased'

### [Update] - 2020-03-17
**Updates to `Layout`:** <br />
([components/layoutheader](https://bitbucket.org/DigMap/lbox-react-core/pull-requests/50/components-layoutheader/diff))

**Reference Story** <br />
[All Regions / Interactive (configured)](http://maps.digitalmapcentral.com/storybook/styled-components/develop/?path=/story/layout-layout--full-interactive-configured)

**Note**: Due to the changeover in story formats, prop tables are missing from many components.  We will be addressing that in a future update.  However, for now, please reference the `propTypes` within the components' `JSX` files.

#### Added
- Added a `bottom` layout region.
- All layout regions have `content` and `id` props.
- Regions `left`, `main`, `right`, and `bottom` now have a `visible` prop.
  - Can be cofigured to `false` to set the display of a region to 'offscreen'.  Default is 'onscreen': `true`.
- A `toggle` prop has been added to all regions that support a `visible` prop.
  - This prop can be used to set up a listener for state functions. (see stories for reference)

#### Changed
- Renamed `Template` to `Layout`
- The header prop is a generic region like all other regions.  It is no longer populated with 'fallback' content.
- With the removal of predefined content form regions, props `iconLeft` and `iconRight` have been removed.

<!-- #### Deprecated -->

#### Removed
- Removed `Template` (no longer need both `Template` and `Layout`)
