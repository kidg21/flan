## Cooking the FLAN - [Link](https://edrnet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UX/pages/940376491/Cooking+the+FLAN)

Until we have an initial versioned `Master` release I will be using this space to document changes to the `Development` branch. Eventually, this will turn into a proper changlog.  We'll do our best to communicate positive and negative impacts of each update.  Bear with us as we work through this approach.  As always, feedback is welcome.

Eventually this document will only pertain to updates to the `Master` branch.  All changes to the `Development` branch will be documented under 'Unreleased'
