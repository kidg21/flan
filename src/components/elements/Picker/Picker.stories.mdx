# Usage

A dialog is a type of modal window that appears in front of app content to provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken. Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly. They must be used in conjunction with **[Modal](/?path=/docs/layout-modal--documentation)**. A Modal is what is used to display the Dialog Box above all other content and grey out the background. When using a Dialog Box the Modal should be set up to cover the entire app.

Dialogs should be used for:
- Errors that block an app’s normal operation
- Critical information that requires a specific user task, decision, or acknowledgement



Be sure to note when to use a Notification vs a Dialog:

- **Banner Notification**	( Low to medium priority )	
Banners remain until dismissed by the user, or if the state that caused the banner is resolved
- **Dialog**	( Highest priority )	
A Required user input. Dialogs block app usage until the user takes a dialog action or exits the dialog

A Dialog can have one or two actions/buttons. When using two buttons, the action that the user should be encouraged to take is positioned on the most right (2nd button).  Use specific verbage and clear action items. Do not use vague "ok" and "yes" as that does not tell the user clearly what action they are performing. A dialog’s purpose should be communicated by its title and button text.

Titles should:

- Contain a brief, clear statement or question
- Avoid apologies (“Sorry for the interruption”), alarm (“Warning!”), or ambiguity (“Are you sure?”)
