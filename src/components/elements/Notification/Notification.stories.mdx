# Notification

#### A Notification displays a prominent message and related optional actions.


<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Standard">
     <Banner variant="success" title="Your payment method has been updated." />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Usage

A Notification displays an important message and sometimes provides actions for users to address (or dismiss the Notification).

Notifications should be displayed at the top of the screen, below a top app or global nav bar. They are triggered by an event or action. They can be closed by the user, if they choose to interact with an available action on it or dismiss it, or by timing out. Only one Notification should be shown at a time.


- **Banner Notification**	( Low to medium priority )	
Notifications remain until dismissed by the user, or if the state that caused the Notification is resolved
- **Dialog**	( Highest priority )	
A Required user input. Dialogs block app usage until the user takes a dialog action or exits the dialog

# Principles

- **Appropriately interruptive**
Notifications are interruptive, but their level of interruption should match the information they contain and the context in which they appear.
- **Clear**
Notifications communicate a succinct message and what will happen if users interact with them.
- **Focused**
Notifications contain a single message and specific actions a user can take.
