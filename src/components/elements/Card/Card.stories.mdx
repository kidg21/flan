# Card

### Cards contain content and actions about a single subject.

# Usage
Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

The difference between Card and Checkbox is that Card will trigger a state change directly when you toggle it, while Checkbox is generally used for state marking, which should work in conjunction with submit operation.

A Card is typically utilized in the following areas:
PrinciplesContained
A card is identifiable as a single, contained unit. Independent
A card can stand alone, without relying on surrounding elements for context.Individual
A card cannot merge with another card, or divide into multiple cards.

- Input Forms
- Filters
- Settings


Cards may appear in groups. When a Card group is necessary use the CardGroup wrapper from the Card directory to control the Card layout.

# Guidelines
- **Opposing Options:**
  Typically Cards would be used where the options are very different from each other so no user would ever consider selecting more than one option. If a user selects Option A, Option B should not be desirable to them.
- **Clear:**
  A Cardâ€™s action and state should be clear.
- **Be Brief**
  Card labels should be short and to the point. They should be one or two words. A label should never be a sentence.

# Anatomy
Cards consist of a circular input and a label. It is important that the label also has an htmlFor Card in order to link the Card and be another way to select.

A Card may appear to the left or right of it's corresponding label. A Card may not appear above or below the label. 

1. Container
Card containers hold all card elements, and their size is determined by the space those elements occupy. Card elevation is expressed by the container.

2. Thumbnail 
Cards can include thumbnails to display an avatar, logo, or icon.

3. Header text 
Header text can include things like the name of a photo album or article.

4. Subhead 
Subhead text can include text elements such as an article byline or a tagged location.

5. Media 
Cards can include a variety of media, including photos, and graphics, such as weather icons.

6. Supporting text 
Supporting text include text like an article summary or a restaurant description.

7. Buttons 
Cards can include buttons for actions.

8. Icons 
Cards can include icons for actions. Each card is made up of content blocks. All of the blocks, as a whole, are related to a single subject or destination. Content can receive different levels of emphasis, depending on its level of hierarchy.

##Behavior

# Examples

### Types
Cards can be outlined or elevated. The default type is outlined. Using an elevated card would be beneficial when emphasizing hierarchy and dimension. Use an elevated card when placed over busy or distracting backgrounds with a lot of content.
<Preview>
  <Story name="Types">
  <React.Fragment>
  <Grid columns="2">
          <Card title="Outlined Card" description="Card Description" />
          <Card title="Elevated Card" description="Card Description" type="elevated" />
          </Grid>
  </React.Fragment>
  </Story>
</Preview>



### Icons
Icons can be used on cards to show additional meaning or identification. Icons must be related to the subject of the card. At this time icons are limited to one icon per card.
<Preview>
  <Story name="Icons">
    <Card
        title="Appraisal Research"
        description="19-0942231 - 123 Main St, Woburn, MA 01801"
        icon="analytics"
      />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Tags
Similar to Icons, Tags are used to provide an additional identifier. Tags can be included when identifying a category, a type, or a group status. As tags can have many colors this is a great way to differentiate between cards.
<Preview>
  <Story name="Tags">
<Card
        title="5201 California Avenue, Irvine, CA 92614"
        line1="APN #23947828"
        line2="Irvine Company"
        tag="Same Owner"
      />
  </Story>
</Preview>



### Media
Cards can have include images. Images need to be relevant to the card subject matter and not vague. Images on cards must follow previous Image component guidelines.
<Preview>
  <Story name="Media">
<Card title="Title" description="Card Description" 
body=<Body text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
