# Banner

### A banner displays a prominent message and related optional actions.


<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Standard">
     <Banner variant="success" title="Your payment method has been updated." />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Usage

A banner displays an important, succinct message, and provides actions for users to address (or dismiss the banner). It requires a user action to be dismissed.

Banners should be displayed at the top of the screen, below a top app bar. Theyâ€™re persistent and nonmodal, allowing the user to either ignore them or interact with them at any time. Only one banner should be shown at a time.


- **Banner Notification**	( Low to medium priority )	
Banners remain until dismissed by the user, or if the state that caused the banner is resolved
- **Dialog**	( Highest priority )	
A Required user input. Dialogs block app usage until the user takes a dialog action or exits the dialog

# Principles

- **Appropriately interruptive**
Banners are interruptive, but their level of interruption should match the information they contain and the context in which they appear.
- **Clear**
Banners communicate a succinct message and what will happen if users interact with them.
- **Focused**
Banners contain a single message and specific actions a user can take.
