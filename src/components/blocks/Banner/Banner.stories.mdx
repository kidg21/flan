# Banner

### A banner displays a prominent message and related optional actions.

  <Story name="Standard">
     <Banner title="This is a Banner." />

# Usage

A banner displays an important, succinct message, and provides actions for users to address (or dismiss the banner). It requires a user action to be dismissed.

Banners should be displayed at the top of the screen, below a top app bar. Theyâ€™re persistent and nonmodal, allowing the user to either ignore them or interact with them at any time. Only one banner should be shown at a time.

- **Notification**	( Low priority ) 
Notification disappear automatically
- **Banner**	( Prominent, medium priority )	
Banners remain until dismissed by the user, or if the state that caused the banner is resolved
- **Dialog**	( Highest priority )	
A Required user input. Dialogs block app usage until the user takes a dialog action or exits the dialog

# Principles

- **Appropriately interruptive**
Banners are interruptive, but their level of interruption should match the information they contain and the context in which they appear.
- **Clear**
Banners communicate a succinct message and what will happen if users interact with them.
- **Focused**
Banners contain a single message and specific actions a user can take.
