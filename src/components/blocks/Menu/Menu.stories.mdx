# Usage

A menu displays a list of choices on a temporary surface. They appear when users interact with a button, action, or other control. Menus appear in front of all other permanent UI elements.

- **Focused**
Menu content should be suited to user needs.

- **Scannable**
Menu items should be easy to scan.

**Nested Menus** allow users to choose from a large variety of choices, by displaying menus with multiple levels of hierarchy. They are organized into menus of parent list items that contain child list items. Child list items appear to the right or left of parent list items, depending on where there is room to expand child list items. Nested Menus are generated based on the data array passed through.

# Examples

### Types

Menus display lists of related options (which can be grouped together) as well as unrelated options. Menus can be text or text and icon. Adding an icon is an additional benefit to the user and provides extra context and guidance. If you are using icon and icons try to make sure that all of the Menu Items have an icon.

### Positions

Menus should be positioned relative to the edge of the screen or browser. They typically appear next to (or in front of) the element that generates them. If they are in a position to be cut off by the browser or screenâ€™s edge, the menu can should appear to the left, right, or above the element that generates it.
