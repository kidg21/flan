# Switch

### A Switch is a control that is used to quickly toggle between two possible states

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <Switch label="Switch" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Usage

Switches are only used for these binary actions that occur immediately after the user “flips” the switch. They are commonly used for “on/off” toggles.
Use if you need to represent the switching between two states or on-off state.

The difference between Switch and Checkbox is that Switch will trigger a state change directly when you toggle it, while Checkbox is generally used for state marking, which should work in conjunction with submit operation.

Switches should be used instead of radio buttons if only one item can be selected from a list.

Use switches to:

- Toggle a single option on or off, on mobile and tablet
- Immediately activate or deactivate something


# Guidelines

- **Opposing Options:**
  Typically Switchs would be used where the options are very different from each other so no user would ever consider selecting more than one option. If a user selects Option A, Option B should not be desirable to them.
- **Clear:**
  A Switch’s action and state should be clear.
- **Be Brief**
  Switch labels should be short and to the point. They should be one or two words. A label should never be a sentence.

# Anatomy

Switchs consist of a circular input and a label. It is important that the label also has an htmlFor tag in order to link the Switch and be another way to select.

# Examples

### States

<!-- We can drop it in a `Preview` to get a code snippet: -->

<Preview>
  <Story name="States">
    <Grid columns="3">
      <Switch label="Selected" checked />
      <Switch label="Unselected" />
      <Switch label="Disabled" disabled />
    </Grid>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Alignment

A Switch may appear to the left or right of it's corresponding label. A Switch may not appear above or below the label.

      <Switch label="Left Aligned" />
      <Switch label="Right Aligned" align="right" />
