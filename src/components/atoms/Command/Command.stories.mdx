# Command

### A Command represents a primary action.

  <Story name="Standard">
    <Command label="Command" icon="circle_solid" isUpload />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Usage

Commands are used primarily launch a workflow or execute a function. Commands may also change what or how data is displayed (i.e., View More, Show All). If the action taken by the user will change or manipulate data, use a **[Button](/?path=/docs/atoms-button--documentation)**.

- A Command can be sourced from our set of **[Standard Commands](/?path=/docs/application-libraries--standard-commands)**.
- Standard Commands pair a Label and Icon.
- Can be configured to use any icon from our **[Icon Library](/?path=/docs/application-libraries-icon-library--app-icons)**.
- Label-only Commands are permitted but it is recommened to use either an inline **[Button](/?path=/docs/atoms-button--documentation)** or a **[Link](/?path=/docs/application-style-guides--typography)**.
- Command labels should be a single word and no more than two words.
- Text should be consistent with the title of the intended action of function.
- Use caution with links that are several words long. It is recommended that links are long enough to be understood by the user, but short enough to prevent text wrapping.
- Avoid the term “click here,” other links to “here,” or the web address itself. Instead, use a meaningful descriptive label for the label.

# Examples

### State

The standard Command uses an anchor tag and inherits anchor styling. To disable a Command, use the 'disabled' prop.

<Preview>
  <Story name="State">
    <Grid columns="3">
      <Command icon="circle_solid" label="Active" />
      <Command icon="circle_solid" label="Disabled" disabled />
    </Grid>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Size

To override the standard size, set the 'size' prop to 'small', or 'large'.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Size">
    <Grid columns="3" align="bottom">
      <Command icon="circle_solid" label="Small" size="sm" />
      <Command icon="circle_solid" label="Standard" />
      <Command icon="circle_solid" label="Large" size="lg" />
    </Grid>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Alignment

The standard Command is left-aligned with its Icon on the left. Set the 'align' prop to 'center' in order to center-align the Command placing its Icon atop the label. Set the 'align' prop to 'right' to right-align the Command with its Icon on the right.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Alignment">
    <Grid columns="3">
      <Command label="Icon-Left" icon="circle_solid" />
      <Command label="Icon-Top" icon="circle_solid" align="center" />
      <Command label="Icon-Right" icon="circle_solid" align="right" />
    </Grid>
