# TextInput

### Text inputs enable the user to interact with and input content and data. This component can be used for long and short form entries

  <Story name="Standard">
    <TextInput label="TextInput" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Usage

A basic widget for getting the user input is a text field. Keyboard and mouse can be used for providing or changing data.

A user input in a form field is needed.

A search input is required.

The difference between TextInput and Checkbox is that TextInput will trigger a state change directly when you toggle it, while Checkbox is generally used for state marking, which should work in conjunction with submit operation.

A TextInput is typically utilized in the following areas:

- Input Forms
- Filters
- Settings

TextInputs may appear in groups. When a TextInput group is necessary use the TextInputGroup wrapper from the TextInput directory to control the TextInput layout.

# Guidelines

- **Opposing Options:**
  Typically TextInputs would be used where the options are very different from each other so no user would ever consider selecting more than one option. If a user selects Option A, Option B should not be desirable to them.
- **Clear:**
  A TextInputâ€™s action and state should be clear.
- **Be Brief**
  TextInput labels should be short and to the point. They should be one or two words. A label should never be a sentence.

        left={<Icon icon="close" type="alert" size="2x" />}
        center={
          <TextInput label="TextInput with a long label because you cannot be concise with your words." />
        }
      />
    </React.Fragment>

# Anatomy

TextInputs consist of a circular input and a label. It is important that the label also has an htmlFor TextInput in order to link the TextInput and be another way to select.

A TextInput may appear to the left or right of it's corresponding label. A TextInput may not appear above or below the label.
