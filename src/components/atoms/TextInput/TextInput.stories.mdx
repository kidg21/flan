# TextInput

### A TextInput is a numeric range selector.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <TextInput label="TextInput" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Usage
A basic widget for getting the user input is a text field. Keyboard and mouse can be used for providing or changing data.

A user input in a form field is needed.

A search input is required.

The difference between TextInput and Checkbox is that TextInput will trigger a state change directly when you toggle it, while Checkbox is generally used for state marking, which should work in conjunction with submit operation.

A TextInput is typically utilized in the following areas:

- Input Forms
- Filters
- Settings


TextInputs may appear in groups. When a TextInput group is necessary use the TextInputGroup wrapper from the TextInput directory to control the TextInput layout.

# Guidelines
- **Opposing Options:**
  Typically TextInputs would be used where the options are very different from each other so no user would ever consider selecting more than one option. If a user selects Option A, Option B should not be desirable to them.
- **Clear:**
  A TextInputâ€™s action and state should be clear.
- **Be Brief**
  TextInput labels should be short and to the point. They should be one or two words. A label should never be a sentence.

###  Do & Don't

  <Story name="Usage">
  <React.Fragment>
      <Bar 
    padding="2x"
    leftWidth="5%"
  centerAlign="left"
  contentAlign="center"
  left={
  <Icon icon="check" type="success" size="2x"/>}
  center={

    />
  <Bar 
  padding="2x"
  leftWidth="5%"
  centerAlign="left"
  contentAlign="center"
  left={
  <Icon icon="close" type="alert" size="2x"/>}
  center={
    <TextInput label="TextInput with a long label because you cannot be concise with your words." />}
    />
    </React.Fragment>
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Anatomy
TextInputs consist of a circular input and a label. It is important that the label also has an htmlFor TextInput in order to link the TextInput and be another way to select.

A TextInput may appear to the left or right of it's corresponding label. A TextInput may not appear above or below the label.
