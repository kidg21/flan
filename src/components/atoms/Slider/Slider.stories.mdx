# Slider

### Sliders provide a visual indication of adjustable content, where the user can move the handle along a horizontal track to increase or decrease the value.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <Slider id="default" label="Slider" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Usage

An input range slider lets the user specify a numeric value which must be between two specified values.
Sliders allow users to make selections from a range of values.

Sliders reflect a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value. They are ideal for adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, or applying image filters.

Sliders can have icons on both ends of the bar that reflect a range of values.

Immediate effects
Changes made with sliders are immediate, allowing a user to make slider adjustments until finding their preference. They shouldnâ€™t be paired with settings that have even minor delays in providing user feedback.

Current state
Sliders reflect the current state of the settings they control.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="RangeSlider">
    <RangeSlider id="defaultRange" label="Slider" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

Sliders may appear in groups. When a Slider group is necessary use the SliderGroup wrapper from the Slider directory to control the Slider layout.

# Guidelines

Editable numeric values
Editable numeric values allow users to set the exact value of a slider.

Upon pressing the thumb or the value indicator field, the value indicator input becomes editable for text entry. The thumb position immediately is updated to match any change in value.

Order of values
For languages that are displayed from left-to-right, such as English, the smallest value for the range appears on the left and the largest value appears on the right.

For right-to-left languages, like Arabic, this placement would be switched (with the largest value on the left, and the smallest on the right).

- **Adjustable**
  Sliders should only be used for choosing selections from a range of values. -**Immediate**
  When interacting with a slider, changes should be represented immediately.
- **Accessible**
  Sliders should provide the full range of choices available for the user to select from.

# Anatomy

A slider can contain the following elements:

1. **Track:**
   The track shows the range available for user selection. For left-to-right (LTR) languages, the smallest value appears on the far left, and the largest value on the far right. For right-to-left (RTL) languages this orientation is reversed, with the smallest value on the far right and the largest value on the far left.

2. **Thumb:**
   The thumb slides along the track, displaying the selected value through its position.

3. **Value label (optional):**
   A value label displays the currently selected, specific numerical value.
