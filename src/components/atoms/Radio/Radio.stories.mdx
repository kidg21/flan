# Radio

### Radio buttons are used when a list of two or more options are mutually exclusive, meaning the user must select only one option.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <Radio label="Radio" selected />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Usage

Radios are used to select a single state from multiple options.

The difference between Checkbox and Radio is that a Radio is used when a user is restricted to select only one option. Checkbox is used when a user is permitted to select multiple options.

Radios are typically utilized in the following areas:

- Input Forms
- Filters
- Settings

Use radio buttons to:

Select a single option from a list
Expose all available options
If available options can be collapsed, consider using a dropdown menu instead, as it uses less space.

# Guidelines

- **Opposing Options:**
  Typically radios would be used where the options are very different from each other so no user would ever consider selecting more than one option. If a user selects Option A, Option B should not be desirable to them.
- **Clear:**
  A Radioâ€™s action and state should be clear.
- **Be Brief**
  Radio labels should be short and to the point. They should be one or two words. A label should never be a sentence.

# Anatomy

Radios consist of a circular input and a label. It is important that the label also has an htmlFor tag in order to link the radio and be another way to select.


<!-- ## Behavior -->

# Examples

### States

<!-- We can drop it in a `Preview` to get a code snippet: -->

<Preview>
  <Story name="States">
    <Grid>
      <Radio label="Selected" checked />
      <Radio label="Unselected" />
      <Radio label="Disabled" disabled />
    </Grid>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Alignment
A radio may appear to the left or right of it's corresponding label. A radio may not appear above or below the label.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Alignment">
    <Grid>
      <Radio label="Left Aligned" />
      <Radio label="Right Aligned" align="right" />
    </Grid>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Group
Radios may appear in groups. When a radio group is necessary use the RadioGroup wrapper from the Radio directory to control the Radio layout.


<Preview>
  <Story name="Radio Group">
    <Grid>
      <Form>
        <Section title="Radio Group (2 Columns)">
          <RadioGroup columns="2">
            <Radio id="radio-1" name="radio-group" value="1" label="Radio 1" />
            <Radio id="radio-2" name="radio-group" value="2" label="Radio 2" />
            <Radio id="radio-3" name="radio-group" value="3" label="Radio 3" />
            <Radio id="radio-4" name="radio-group" value="4" label="Radio 4" />
          </RadioGroup>
        </Section>
      </Form>
    </Grid>
  </Story>
</Preview>
