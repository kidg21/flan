# Tag

### Tags are used for items that need to be labeled, categorized, or organized using keywords that describe them.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <Tag label="Tag" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Usage

If you need to represent the Taging between two states or on-off state.

The difference between Tag and Checkbox is that Tag will trigger a state change directly when you toggle it, while Checkbox is generally used for state marking, which should work in conjunction with submit operation.

A Tag is typically utilized in the following areas:

- Input Forms
- Filters
- Settings

Tags may appear in groups. When a Tag group is necessary use the TagGroup wrapper from the Tag directory to control the Tag layout.

# Guidelines

- **Opposing Options:**
  Typically Tags would be used where the options are very different from each other so no user would ever consider selecting more than one option. If a user selects Option A, Option B should not be desirable to them.
- **Clear:**
  A Tagâ€™s action and state should be clear.
- **Be Brief**
  Tag labels should be short and to the point. They should be one or two words. A label should never be a sentence.

        center={

# Anatomy

Tags consist of a circular input and a label. It is important that the label also has an htmlFor tag in order to link the Tag and be another way to select.

A Tag may appear to the left or right of it's corresponding label. A Tag may not appear above or below the label.
